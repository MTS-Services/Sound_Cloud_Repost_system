                    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-4">
                        RepostChain is a digital networking and music promotion platform that connects artists for
                        repost
                        and collaboration campaigns.
                    </p>
                    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-4">
                        When you purchase credits, subscriptions, or promotional packages, you gain access to digital
                        services, not physical goods.
                    </p>
                    <p class="leading-relaxed">
                        Because of the instant and non-reversible nature of digital campaigns, certain restrictions
                        apply to
                        refunds and cancellations.
